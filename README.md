# Qiskit Fall Fest 2024

Website for the Qiskit event at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria.
 

# Welcome
Welcome to **Qiskit Fall Fest 2024**! This event is a global celebration of quantum computing, hosted by universities, student groups, and quantum enthusiasts across the world. The goal is to provide a hands-on, collaborative learning experience in the growing field of quantum computing, with a focus on using the open-source Qiskit framework.

## Introduction

**Qiskit** is an open-source quantum computing framework developed by IBM. It allows users to write quantum algorithms and execute them on simulators or real quantum devices. Qiskit is designed to help you learn quantum computing, explore its applications, and solve real-world problems using quantum algorithms.

## Event Overview

The **Qiskit Fall Fest 2024** is a series of workshops, hackathons, and meetups, tailored to all skill levels—whether you are a complete beginner, an enthusiast, or a seasoned quantum developer.

### Key Highlights
